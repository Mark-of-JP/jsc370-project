# Introduction

Within this project, I gathered data from the internationally beloved, (and hated) video game known as League of Legends. With the data I collected I fitted an xgboost and matrix factorization model to better understand how to win League of Legend games.

The xgboost model was used to understand what metrics and decisions were the most influential. The resulting model was 73% accurate on predicting if the player won depending on how well they did.

The matrix factorization model was used to better understand how different and unique the differing champions are. It helped us understand if actually choosing the "best" champion mattered or if you could just choose any champion that you desired and work on perfecting your skills with them.

This assignment was made for the UofT JSC370 Data Science class.
